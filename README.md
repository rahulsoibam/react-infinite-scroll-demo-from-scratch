# React Infinite Scroll Demo from Scratch

Note: for production, it is simpler, faster and probably better to use libraries like `react-intersection-observer` for the infinite scroll and `@tanstack/react-query` for getting the API responses.

This project uses the PEXELS API (https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation) to fetch photos.
